        <p class="para"><strong>Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using ... This solar resource map provides a summary of the estimated solar energy available for power generation and other energy applications. ... The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550 MW power plant in Riverside County, California. </strong></p>
        <p class="para"> <strong>   Photovoltaic systems use no fuel, and modules typically last 25 to 40 years. Thus, capital costs make up most of the cost of solar power. Operations and maintenance costs for new utility-scale solar plants in the US are estimated to be 9 percent of the cost of photovoltaic electricity, and 17 percent of the cost of solar thermal electricity.[79] Governments have created various financial incentives to encourage the use of solar power, such as feed-in tariff programs. Also, Renewable portfolio standards impose a government mandate that utilities generate or acquire a certain percentage of renewable power regardless of increased energy procurement costs. In most states, RPS goals can be achieved by any combination of solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, ocean, geothermal, municipal solid waste, hydroelectric, hydrogen, or fuel cell technologies</strong></p>

        <p class="para"><strong>Depending on the marketplace and business model, utility companies face unique as well as universal challenges caused by digital transformation and the entrance of new players into the sector. However, these same challenges are also windows of opportunity, providing utility businesses with the tools they need to survive and grow sustainably in an increasingly mobile, efficiency- and customer-driven economy.



Smart cities, smart grids, real-time consumer networks and more – these innovations aren’t on the horizon, they’re here and now. The future of the utilities sector lies in its ability to adapt and bring real value-added services to customers in creative ways.</strong></p>
